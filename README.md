# Simulate Controlled OUTliers - SCOUTer
(R version)
SCOUTer is a set of functions that open the door towards a new way of 
simulating outliers. Using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) as a base 
model, SCOUTer enables the user to control exactly how the simulated 
outliers will be.

This is possible by controlling the pair of properties that define 
outliers: the Squared Prediction Error (_SPE_) and the Hotelling's $T^2$. 
By setting the desired target values to these statistics, the user can 
obtain *all* types of outliers.
 
Control your simulations with SCOUTer in an *easy and interactive* way.

*!!Important:* This github repo contains an unstable version updated regularly. For the stable and CRAN approved version, check: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/SCOUTer/index.html

Enjoy!
