\title{Shift of an array with a single step.}
\usage{
scoutsimple(X, pcaref, T2.target = NA, SPE.target = NA)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{Matrix with observations that will be shifted as rows.}

\item{pcaref}{List with the elemements of a PCA model: \code{m} (mean), \code{s} (standard deviation), \code{prepro} (preprocessing:
\code{"none"}, \code{"cent"} or \code{"autosc"}), \code{P} (loading matrix), \code{lambda} (vector with variances of each PC).}

\item{T2.target}{A number indicating the target value for the T^2_A after the shift. Set to \code{NA} by default.}

\item{SPE.target}{A number indicating the target value for the SPE after the shift. Set to \code{NA} by default.}
}
\value{
list with elements: \code{X}, matrix with the new and shifted data, \code{SPE} and \code{T2} vectors with the statistic values
of each one of the new generated outliers or observations, elements \code{step.spe} and \code{step.t2} make reference to the step
of each observation. Finally, the element \code{tag}, is a vector of ones as long as the number of generated observations.
