Description: SCOUTer enables the user to control in a precise way the outlying properties of simulated data.
This is possible by controlling the pair of properties that define outliers: the Squared Prediction Error (SPE) and the
Hotelling's . By setting the desired target values to these statistics, the user can obtain all types of outliers.
