Description: Using Principal Component Analysis as a base model, the user can generate new observations defining them through a pair of well-known statistics: the Squared Prediction Error and the Hotelling's T2 statistics. Just by introducing the target values of the SPE and T^2, SCOUTer returns a new set of observations with the desired target properties. SCOUTer offers a new approach to simulate outliers in a simple and precise way.
