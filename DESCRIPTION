Description: Using Principal Component Analysis as a base model, 'SCOUTer' offers a new approach to simulate outliers in a simple and precise way. The user can generate new observations defining them by a pair of well-known statistics: the Squared Prediction Error and the Hotelling's T^2 statistics. Just by introducing the target values of the SPE and T^2, 'SCOUTer' returns a new set of observations with the desired target properties. Authors: Alba Gonz√°lez, Abel Folch-Fortuny, Francisco Arteaga and Alberto Ferrer (2020).
